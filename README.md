# LinkedIn Feed Cleaner
Chrome extension to remove unwanted posts from your linkedin feed

## Why this exists?
You might have seen that LinkedIn has turned into a mix of Quora, Facebook and TikTok. Everyone is trying to become an "influencer" and gain followers.
LinkedIn, as a platform, is also not doing anything. Instead it is encouraging this behaviour by adding features like âœ¨Creator Modeâœ¨ and âœ¨LinkedIn top Voicesâœ¨ awards. 

More often than not these influencers are just doing brand promotions and creating unnecessary roadmaps. 

This is one of the posts which talks about this: [RANT - Linkedin people you can block to prevent feed from spam content](https://www.teamblind.com/post/RANT---Linkedin-people-you-can-block-to-prevent-feed-from-spam-content-SbN6Xdx1)
